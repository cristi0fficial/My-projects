In conclusion, the provided C++ code demonstrates a basic implementation of a Library system using two classes: Book and Library. The Book class encapsulates information about a book, including its title, author, and ISBN. The Library class manages a collection of books and provides functionality to add, remove, and display books.
The main function initializes a Library object, adds several books to it, displays the initial list of books, removes one book based on its ISBN, and displays the updated list of books.
However, it's important to note that this code is a basic example, and in a real-world scenario, additional features, error handling, and user interactions would likely be necessary. Moreover, the use of “using namespace std;” is present, but in larger projects, it is generally recommended to avoid this using directive and specify the namespace where needed to prevent naming conflicts.
